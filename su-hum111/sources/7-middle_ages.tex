\begin{frame}{How Many Popes?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1->1309--1378. Papacy moved to Avignon.
		\item<2->1377. Pope Gregory XI moves back to Rome and promptly dies.
		\item<3->1378. Two popes elected by different sets of cardinals. Urban VI in Rome and Clement VII in France.
		\item<4->1378--1409. Multiple popes elected in both courts. Much confusion.
		\item<5->1409. Council of Pisa (the "Let's elect another pope!" council). Now, there are 3 popes. Confused yet?
		\item<6->1414--1417. Council of Constance. Cardinals decided they had more power than the Pope(s). 2 popes (the Italian ones) stepped down amicably. The Avignon Papacy continued its claim for a few more years.
