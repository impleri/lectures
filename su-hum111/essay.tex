\section*{Assignment 1: Essay}
\emph{Due Week 4 and worth 100 points}

Choose one (1) of the topics below and develop a three to four (3--4) paragraph essay (at least 250 words) in which you:
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item Clearly state the ``mystery'' and provide a brief summary of at least two (2) theories which could explain the mystery. Because some theories may sound far-fetched, include the source or promoter of each theory â€“ such as a scientist, a historian, a theologian, etc.
	\item Identify one (1) of the theories and provide at least two (2) convincing reasons why the theory you have chosen is the best one to explain the mystery.
	\item Use at least two (2) sources \emph{besides the textbook}.
\end{enumerate*}

\subsection*{Topic Choices}
\begin{enumerate*}
	\item There have been many theories regarding how the pyramids at Giza were constructed. They were constructed as burial monuments for pharaohs, but ``how'' these ancient people constructed monuments of such great size without modern machinery is a mystery which is still being debated.

	\item No one can say for certain what happened to the Mayan people, but theories abound and include varied possible alternatives to explain the abrupt and mysterious disappearance of the Mayan civilization.

	\item It is believed that Queen Hatshepsut dressed as a man to gain support of the Egyptians. After her death, her successor removed as many remnants of her rule as possible. Although a pharaoh, her mummified remains and tomb have never been conclusively found.

	\item Tutankhamen died young, at around 18 years of age. However, his cause of death has not been confirmed. Did he die of an injury, of illness, or was he murdered?

	\item Considered the ``Mummy's Curse,'' a series of unexplainable, unfortunate, or tragic events that happened to the people who were present at the opening of Tutankhamen's tomb.

	\item The monumental size and complexity of the Tomb of Shihuangdi is astounding. It is believed that the workers were forced to remain inside the tomb when it was walled shut so they would not reveal the secrets of its construction. What was the emperor's purpose for such an elaborate burial place?

	\item Other topic choice recommended and approved by the professor and supported by the grading rubric.
\end{enumerate*}
