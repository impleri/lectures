Lectures
========

Presentation slides (using LaTeX/Beamer and LaTeX/examdesign) for various university courses.

A repository of lecture slides/notes given by me (universities are made anonymous, hopefully). Quiz files may also be provided after they are retired.

== Packages Required ==

Most LaTeX installations should handle this without difficulty. The primary packages in use, Beamer and examdesign, are included in TeTeX-Live.
