# Lectures

Presentation slides (using LaTeX/Beamer and LaTeX/examdesign) for various university courses.

A repository of lecture slides/notes given by me (universities are made anonymous, hopefully). Quiz files may also be provided after they are retired.

## Packages Required

Most LaTeX installations should handle this without difficulty. The primary packages in use, Beamer and examdesign, are included in TeTeX-Live. This also uses the beamerarticle package (which is also included in TeTeX-Live) to create outlined handouts to go with the presentation (rather than printing a page for each slide!).

2. su-hum112: A general humanities course which covers the period from the Renaissance to modern times.
